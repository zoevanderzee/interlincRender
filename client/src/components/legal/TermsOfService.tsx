      <h1>Interlinc Terms of Service</h1>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">Last updated: January 2025</p>
      
      <p>
        These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Interlinc platform ("Interlinc", "we", "our", "the Platform"). 
        By creating an account, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
      </p>
      <p className="font-semibold">
        If you do not agree, you must not register or use Interlinc.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Nature of the Platform</h2>
      <p>
        Interlinc is an online marketplace that connects Businesses ("Clients") with independent contractors ("Contractors").
      </p>
      <p>Interlinc:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>does not provide services</li>
        <li>does not employ Contractors</li>
        <li>does not guarantee outcomes</li>
        <li>is not a staffing agency or employment service</li>
        <li>does not act as Merchant of Record for contractor services</li>
        <li>does not hold Client or Contractor funds</li>
        <li>does not provide escrow</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All work is performed directly between Clients and Contractors.</p>

      <h2>2. Accounts & Eligibility</h2>
      <p>To use Interlinc you must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>be at least 18</li>
        <li>have the legal capacity to enter contracts</li>
        <li>provide accurate information</li>
        <li>not use the Platform for illegal or prohibited purposes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Interlinc may suspend or terminate your account at any time for violations, risk, fraud, or abusive behaviour.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Independent Contractor Status</h2>
      <p>
        Contractors using Interlinc are not employees, agents, or representatives of Interlinc.
      </p>
      <p>Contractors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>operate as independent businesses</li>
        <li>set their own pricing</li>
        <li>are responsible for their tax filings</li>
        <li>are responsible for compliance with local laws</li>
        <li>own and deliver their work independently</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Clients acknowledge that Contractors — not Interlinc — are solely responsible for the performance and quality of services.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Payments (via Stripe Connect)</h2>
      <p>Payments on Interlinc are processed by Stripe, not by Interlinc.</p>
      <p>By using the Platform, you agree to Stripe's Terms of Service.</p>
      <p>Key facts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contractors receive payments directly via Stripe Connect</li>
        <li>Interlinc does not hold funds</li>
        <li>Interlinc is not the Merchant of Record</li>
        <li>Interlinc may charge platform fees where applicable</li>
        <li>Refunds are handled directly between Client and Contractor</li>
        <li>Stripe controls onboarding, payouts, verification, and compliance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Interlinc has no responsibility for Stripe actions, delays, rejections, onboarding decisions, or payout schedules.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Invoicing</h2>
      <p>Interlinc automatically generates invoices or receipts as records of transactions.</p>
      <p>You acknowledge that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interlinc is not providing tax advice</li>
        <li>Interlinc is not responsible for your tax compliance</li>
        <li>Contractors are responsible for issuing legally required invoices if applicable</li>
        <li>Clients are responsible for their own bookkeeping and reporting obligations</li>
        <li>Interlinc's invoices are informational and provided "as-is"</li>
        <li>Interlinc does not guarantee country-specific tax compliance or jurisdictional e-invoicing regulations unless explicitly stated.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Disputes Between Clients and Contractors</h2>
      <p>Interlinc is not a party to the contract between Client and Contractor.</p>
      <p>Therefore:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interlinc is not responsible for disputes</li>
        <li>Interlinc does not mediate disagreements</li>
        <li>Interlinc does not guarantee results</li>
        <li>Interlinc does not provide refunds</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Clients and Contractors must resolve disputes independently.</p>

      <h2>7. Prohibited Use</h2>
      <p>You may not use Interlinc to:</p>

        <li>avoid payment outside the platform</li>
        <li>misuse data</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Interlinc may suspend or terminate accounts for violations.</p>

      <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>Unless otherwise stated:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contractors retain ownership of their work</li>

        <li>Interlinc claims no ownership over user-generated content</li>
        <li>Users are responsible for ensuring IP agreements between them.</li>
      </ul>
