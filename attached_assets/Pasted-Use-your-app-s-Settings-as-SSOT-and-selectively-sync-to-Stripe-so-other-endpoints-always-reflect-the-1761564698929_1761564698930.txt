Use your app’s Settings as SSOT and selectively sync to Stripe so other endpoints always reflect the same values.
Sync rules
Business (payer) → Stripe Customer
On org name/email/address/tax ID change in Settings:
Update the Stripe Customer: name, email, address, tax_ids.
Impact: payer info on receipts/invoices stays current. Does not affect merchant name.
Contractor (merchant) → Stripe Connected Account
If you use Express: contractors manage their public business info/descriptor in the Stripe-hosted dashboard (you can deep-link them back to “Update payout/brand in Stripe”). You may prefill some fields, but the descriptor is theirs.
If you use Custom: you manage their account; on contractor profile changes that affect merchant display, update the Connected Account business_profile.name, support_email, and (if permitted) statement descriptor.
Impact: this is what controls the merchant name.
Mapping: App Settings ⇄ Stripe
App field (SSOT)	Stripe object	Stripe field(s)	Why
Business display name	Customer (platform)	name	Payer identity on receipts
Business billing/email	Customer (platform)	email, address, tax_ids	Invoices/receipts, tax
Contractor business name	Connected Account	business_profile.name	Merchant display
Contractor support email/url	Connected Account	business_profile.support_email, business_profile.url	Receipts/support
Statement descriptor (contractor)	Connected Account	settings.card_payments.statement_descriptor	Card statement text
Guardrails so nothing “fights”
Do not try to make your Settings overwrite the contractor’s descriptor if you’re on Express—that’s theirs to edit in Stripe. Instead, provide a “Manage payout & branding in Stripe” link.
Keep OBO + transfer_data.destination set to the contractor on every PaymentIntent. That alone prevents your platform from being shown as merchant.
Continue creating/maintaining a Stripe Customer for each business; keep it in sync from your Settings so payer info is current.
Practical checklist
App SSOT: users/organizations/org_members are authoritative for names, titles, logos, addresses.
Business updates name/email/address: enqueue job to update Stripe Customer.
Contractor updates merchant-facing details:
Express → send them to Stripe Account settings page (Account Links).
Custom → update Connected Account business profile (server job).
Payments: always set on_behalf_of = contractor_acct and transfer_data.destination = contractor_acct.
Verify in Dashboard (test payment):
“On behalf of” = contractor.
“Transferred to” = contractor.
Receipt header/descriptor shows contractor branding.
Customer section shows business name/email.
Bottom line
Yes, keep your own Settings. That’s the easiest way to update every endpoint and UI consistently.
Sync to Stripe only the fields Stripe uses (Customer for payers; Connected Account profile/descriptor for contractors).
With OBO, your Settings won’t override the merchant name unless you intentionally update the contractor’s connected account branding.
