✅ Prompt: Full App Audit by User Type (Business & Contractor)
Conduct a complete end-to-end audit of the app across both user roles — Business and Contractor — to ensure functional, visual, and financial consistency. The app is considered near-final, and this audit is to catch all remaining issues prior to launch.
🔍 GENERAL (GLOBAL CHECKS)
UI Consistency
Confirm consistent theme, font, spacing, and component usage across all views.
Mobile responsiveness and layout handling for edge cases (e.g., overflow menus, modals, long names).
Currency Handling
Ensure businesses can select their currency during onboarding or in settings.
The selected currency updates all pricing UI throughout the app (dashboards, work requests, modals).
Confirm fallback/default currency behavior (e.g. if not selected).
Contractor views respect the business’s currency and do not convert it automatically.
Country Selection
Country selection should affect default currency (where appropriate).
Any location-based UI (like time zones or payment options) reflects the selected country.
Check for edge cases (e.g., territories, eurozone, etc.).
