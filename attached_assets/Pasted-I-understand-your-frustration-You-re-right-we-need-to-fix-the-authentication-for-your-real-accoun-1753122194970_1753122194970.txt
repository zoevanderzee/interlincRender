I understand your frustration. You're right - we need to fix the authentication for your real account, not demo accounts. Let me debug what's happening with your actual login.

Let me check the Firebase authentication flow and see what's breaking:

Opened client/src/lib/firebase-auth.ts

Opened client/src/pages/auth.tsx
I see the issue! The problem is in the authentication flow. When you try to login with your real account, you're getting a Firebase network error. Let me check what's happening in the login process:

Opened client/src/pages/auth.tsx

Executed cd client && grep -n "handleFirebaseLogin\|handlePostgresLogin" src/pages/auth.tsx
I need to find the actual login handlers. Let me search for them:

Opened client/src/pages/auth.tsx

Executed cd client && grep -n -A10 -B5 "handleLogin\|onLogin\|loginForm" src/pages/auth.tsx | head -50
Perfect! Now I can see the real issue. You're using Firebase authentication for login, but after Firebase login succeeds, the system isn't properly storing the authentication data in localStorage. The problem is in the handleLogin function - it calls Firebase loginUser() but then just redirects without properly syncing with the backend or storing the auth data.

Let me fix this by making the Firebase login properly sync with our backend and store the authentication data:

Edited client/src/pages/auth.tsx
Now I need to test this with your real account. I can see from the logs that there was a sync call earlier that succeeded. Try logging in now with your real account - the system should now:

Authenticate with Firebase
Sync with our backend
Retrieve your user data
Store the authentication data properly in localStorage
Redirect you to the dashboard
The key difference is that now the login process will:

Store your actual user ID from the database in localStorage.setItem('user_id', userData.id)
Store your Firebase UID in localStorage.setItem('firebase_uid', result.user.uid)
Then all subsequent API requests will include both X-User-ID and X-Firebase-UID headers
Try logging in with your real account credentials now. You should see detailed console logs showing each step of the process.
