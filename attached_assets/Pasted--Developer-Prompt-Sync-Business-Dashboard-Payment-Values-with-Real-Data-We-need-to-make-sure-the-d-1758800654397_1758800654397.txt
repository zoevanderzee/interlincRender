✅ Developer Prompt: Sync Business Dashboard Payment Values with Real Data
We need to make sure the dashboard values displayed to business users are accurately calculated and reflect their real usage within Interlinc.
Wherever these values are shown visually on the dashboard, the following rules must apply:
1. "Payments Processed"
Where it appears in UI:
Where we show the total number or value of payments processed by the business (e.g., under "Payments Processed" or similar heading).
How to populate:
Show the sum total of all successful payments the business has made to contractors via Interlinc.
This should reflect only completed (succeeded) payments.
Do not include failed, pending, or cancelled payments.
The number should dynamically update based on the actual transactions associated with this business user.
2. "Budget Used"
Where it appears in UI:
Where we show a business's current monthly usage or budget spent.
How to populate:
Show the total amount paid by the business in the current calendar month.
If the business has a monthly budget set in their profile, calculate the remaining amount as well.
Reset this value at the beginning of each new month.
Display in the correct currency format.
3. "Monthly Payments" and "Annual Payments"
Where it appears in UI:
Where we show breakdowns of spend for the current month and year.
How to populate:
Monthly Total: Total of all successful payments made by the business since the 1st of the current month.
Annual Total: Total of all successful payments made by the business since January 1st of the current year.
These values should update automatically and consistently reflect completed transactions only.
General Notes:
Use our internal records of payments (i.e., what we store in our database), not what appears in the Stripe dashboard — since destination charge payments don’t show under the business’s Stripe account.
Each payment must be tied to the correct businessId or internal identifier so that totals are calculated per user.
Use the existing visual containers in the UI (i.e., where the values are currently displayed) and ensure the variables populating those containers reflect the rules above.
