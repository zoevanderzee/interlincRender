API Reference

Copy for LLM

View as Markdown
The Stripe API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
You can use the Stripe API in test mode, which doesn’t affect your live data or interact with the banking networks. The API key you use to authenticate the request determines whether the request is live mode or test mode.
The Stripe API doesn’t support bulk updates. You can work on only one object per request.
The Stripe API differs for every account as we release new versions and tailor functionality.

Authentication 
Ask about this section
Copy for LLM

View as Markdown
The Stripe API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the Stripe Dashboard.
Test mode secret keys have the prefix sk_test_ and live mode secret keys have the prefix sk_live_. Alternatively, you can use restricted API keys for granular permissions.
Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
Use your API key by setting it in the initial configuration of stripe. The Node.js library will then automatically send this key in each request.
You can also set a per-request key with an option. This is often useful for Connect applications that use multiple API keys during the lifetime of a process. Methods on the returned object reuse the same API key.
All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

To act as connected accounts, clients can issue requests using the Stripe-Account special header. Make sure that this header contains a Stripe account ID, which usually starts with the acct_ prefix.
The value is set per-request as shown in the adjacent code sample. Methods on the returned object reuse the same account ID.

Errors 
Ask about this section
Copy for LLM

View as Markdown
Stripe uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Stripe’s servers (these are rare).
Some 4xx errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., a card is declined) include an error code that briefly explains the error reported.

HTTP STATUS CODE SUMMARY
200	OK	Everything worked as expected.
400	Bad Request	The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
401	Unauthorized	No valid API key provided.
402	Request Failed	The parameters were valid but the request failed.
403	Forbidden	The API key doesn’t have permissions to perform the request.
404	Not Found	The requested resource doesn’t exist.
409	Conflict	The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key).
424	External Dependency Failed	The request couldn’t be completed due to a failure in a dependency external to Stripe.
429	Too Many Requests	Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests.
500, 502, 503, 504	Server Errors	Something went wrong on Stripe’s end. (These are rare.)
ERROR TYPES
api_error	API errors cover any other type of problem (e.g., a temporary problem with Stripe’s servers), and are extremely uncommon.
card_error	Card errors are the most common type of error you should expect to handle. They result when the user enters a card that can’t be charged for some reason.
idempotency_error	Idempotency errors occur when an Idempotency-Key is re-used on a request that does not match the first request’s API endpoint and parameters.
invalid_request_error	Invalid request errors arise when your request has invalid parameters.
Handling errors

Our Client libraries raise exceptions for many reasons, such as a failed charge, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability. We recommend writing code that gracefully handles all possible API exceptions.
Related guide: Error Handling
Server-side language

// Note: Node.js API does not throw exceptions, and instead prefers the
// asynchronous style of error handling described below.
//
// An error from the Stripe API or an otherwise asynchronous error
// will be available as the first argument of any Stripe method's callback:
// E.g. stripe.customers.create({...}, function(err, result) {});
//
// Or in the form of a rejected promise.
// E.g. stripe.customers.create({...}).then(
//        function(result) {},
//        function(err) {}
//      );
switch (err.type) {
  case 'StripeCardError':
    // A declined card error
    err.message; // => e.g. "Your card's expiration year is invalid."
    break;
  case 'StripeRateLimitError':
    // Too many requests made to the API too quickly
    break;
  case 'StripeInvalidRequestError':
    // Invalid parameters were supplied to Stripe's API
    break;
  case 'StripeAPIError':
    // An error occurred internally with Stripe's API
    break;
  case 'StripeConnectionError':
    // Some kind of error occurred during the HTTPS communication

Expanding Responses 
Ask about this section
Copy for LLM

View as Markdown
Many objects allow you to request additional information as an expanded response by using the expand request parameter. This parameter is available on all API requests, and applies to the response of that request only. You can expand responses in two ways.
In many cases, an object contains the ID of a related object in its response properties. For example, a Charge might have an associated Customer ID. You can expand these objects in line with the expand request parameter. The expandable label in this documentation indicates ID fields that you can expand into objects.
Some available fields aren’t included in the responses by default, such as the number and cvc fields for the Issuing Card object. You can request these fields as an expanded response by using the expand request parameter.
You can expand recursively by specifying nested fields after a dot (.). For example, requesting payment_intent.customer on a charge expands the payment_intent property into a full PaymentIntent object, then expands the customer property on that payment intent into a full Customer object.
You can use the expand parameter on any endpoint that returns expandable fields, including list, create, and update endpoints.
Expansions on list requests start with the data property. For example, you can expand data.customers on a request to list charges and associated customers. Performing deep expansions on numerous list requests might result in slower processing times.
Expansions have a maximum depth of four levels (for example, the deepest expansion allowed when listing charges is data.payment_intent.customer.default_source).
You can expand multiple objects at the same time by identifying multiple items in the expand array.

Idempotent requests 
Ask about this section
Copy for LLM

View as Markdown
The API supports idempotency for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. When creating or updating an object, use an idempotency key. Then, if a connection error occurs, you can safely repeat the request without risk of creating a second object or performing the update twice.
To perform an idempotent request, provide an additional IdempotencyKey element to the request options.
Stripe’s idempotency works by saving the resulting status code and body of the first request made for any given idempotency key, regardless of whether it succeeds or fails. Subsequent requests with the same key return the same result, including 500 errors.
A client generates an idempotency key, which is a unique key that the server uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same request. How you create unique keys is up to you, but we suggest using V4 UUIDs, or another random string with enough entropy to avoid collisions. Idempotency keys are up to 255 characters long.
You can remove keys from the system automatically after they’re at least 24 hours old. We generate a new request if a key is reused after the original is pruned. The idempotency layer compares incoming parameters to those of the original request and errors if they’re not the same to prevent accidental misuse.
We save results only after the execution of an endpoint begins. If incoming parameters fail validation, or the request conflicts with another request that’s executing concurrently, we don’t save the idempotent result because no API endpoint initiates the execution. You can retry these requests. Learn more about when you can retry idempotent requests.
All POST requests accept idempotency keys. Don’t send idempotency keys in GET and DELETE requests because it has no effect. These requests are idempotent by definition.

Include-dependent response values (API v2) 
Ask about this section
Copy for LLM

View as Markdown
Some API v2 responses contain null values for certain properties by default, regardless of their actual values. That reduces the size of response payloads while maintaining the basic response structure. To retrieve the actual values for those properties, specify them in the include array request parameter.
To determine whether you need to use the include parameter in a given request, look at the request description. The include parameter’s enum values represent the response properties that depend on the include parameter.
NOTE
Whether a response property defaults to null depends on the request endpoint, not the object that the endpoint references. If multiple endpoints return data from the same object, a particular property can depend on include in one endpoint and return its actual value by default for a different endpoint.
A hash property can depend on a single include value, or on multiple include values associated with its child properties. For example, when updating an Account, to return actual values for the entire identity hash, specify identity in the include parameter. Otherwise, the identity hash is null in the response. However, to return actual values for the configuration hash, you must specify individual configurations in the request. If you specify at least one configuration, but not all of them, specified configurations return actual values and unspecified configurations return null. If you don’t specify any configurations, the configuration hash is null in the response.

Metadata 
Ask about this section
Copy for LLM

View as Markdown
Updateable Stripe objects—including Account, Charge, Customer, PaymentIntent, Refund, Subscription, and Transfer have a metadata parameter. You can use this parameter to attach key-value data to these Stripe objects.
You can specify up to 50 keys, with key names up to 40 characters long and values up to 500 characters long. Keys and values are stored as strings and can contain any characters with one exception: you can’t use square brackets ([ and ]) in keys.
You can use metadata to store additional, structured information on an object. For example, you could store your user’s full name and corresponding unique identifier from your system on a Stripe Customer object. Stripe doesn’t use metadata—for example, we don’t use it to authorize or decline a charge and it won’t be seen by your users unless you choose to show it to them.
Some of the objects listed above also support a description parameter. You can use the description parameter to annotate a charge-for example, a human-readable description such as 2 shirts for test@example.com. Unlike metadata, description is a single string, which your users might see (for example, in email receipts Stripe sends on your behalf).
Don’t store any sensitive information (bank account numbers, card details, and so on) as metadata or in the description parameter.
Related guide: Metadata
Sample metadata use cases
Link IDs: Attach your system’s unique IDs to a Stripe object to simplify lookups. For example, add your order number to a charge, your user ID to a customer or recipient, or a unique receipt number to a transfer.
Refund papertrails: Store information about the reason for a refund and the individual responsible for its creation.
Customer details: Annotate a customer by storing an internal ID for your future use.

Pagination 
Ask about this section
Copy for LLM

View as Markdown
All top-level API resources have support for bulk fetches through “list” API methods. For example, you can list charges, list customers, and list invoices. These list API methods share a common structure and accept, at a minimum, the following three parameters: limit, starting_after, and ending_before.
Stripe’s list API methods use cursor-based pagination through the starting_after and ending_before parameters. Both parameters accept an existing object ID value (see below) and return objects in reverse chronological order. The ending_before parameter returns objects listed before the named object. The starting_after parameter returns objects listed after the named object. These parameters are mutually exclusive. You can use either the starting_after or ending_before parameter, but not both simultaneously.
Our client libraries offer auto-pagination helpers to traverse all pages of a list.
Parameters


limit
optional, default is 10
This specifies a limit on the number of objects to return, ranging between 1 and 100.

starting_after
optional object ID
A cursor to use in pagination. starting_after is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include starting_after=obj_foo to fetch the next page of the list.

ending_before
optional object ID
A cursor to use in pagination. ending_before is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with obj_bar, your subsequent call can include ending_before=obj_bar to fetch the previous page of the list.
List Response Format

Some top-level API resource have support for retrieval via “search” API methods. For example, you can search charges, search customers, and search subscriptions.
Stripe’s search API methods utilize cursor-based pagination via the page request parameter and next_page response parameter. For example, if you make a search request and receive "next_page": "pagination_key" in the response, your subsequent call can include page=pagination_key to fetch the next page of results.
Our client libraries offer auto-pagination helpers to easily traverse all pages of a search result.
Search request format


query

Auto-pagination

Our libraries support auto-pagination. This feature allows you to easily iterate through large lists of resources without having to manually perform the requests to fetch subsequent pages.
To use the auto-pagination feature in Node 10+, simply iterate over a “list” call with the parameters you need in a for await loop.
To use the auto-pagination feature in older versions of Node, issue a “list” call with the parameters you need, then call autoPagingEach(onItem) on the returned list object to iterate over all objects matching your initial parameters.
Full docs are on the stripe-node GitHub repository.

Versioning 
Ask about this section
Copy for LLM

View as Markdown
Each major release, such as Acacia, includes changes that aren’t backward-compatible with previous releases. Upgrading to a new major release can require updates to existing code. Each monthly release includes only backward-compatible changes, and uses the same name as the last major release. You can safely upgrade to a new monthly release without breaking any existing code. The current version is 2025-08-27.basil. For information on all API versions, view our API changelog.
Starting from stripe-node v12, the requests you send using stripe-node align with the API version that was current when your version of stripe-node was released. This ensures that your TypeScript types are compatible with the API version you use.
On stripe-node v11 or lower, requests made with stripe-node use your Stripe account’s default API version (controlled in Workbench).
You can override the API version in your code in all versions.
To override the API version, provide the apiVersion option when initializing the library, or set it per-request. This might cause inaccurate Typescript types.
Webhook events also use your account’s API version by default, unless you set an API version during endpoint creation.
You can upgrade your API version in Workbench. As a precaution, use API versioning to test a new API version before committing to an upgrade.

Accounts v2
Ask about this section
Copy for LLM

View as Markdown
An Account v2 object represents a company, individual, or other entity that interacts with a platform on Stripe. It contains both identifying information and properties that control its behavior and functionality. An Account can have one or more configurations that enable sets of related features, such as allowing it to act as a merchant or customer.
The Accounts v2 API supports both the Global Payouts preview feature and the Connect-Billing integration preview feature. However, a particular Account can only access one of them.
The Connect-Billing integration preview feature allows an Account v2 to pay subscription fees to a platform. An Account v1 required a separate Customer object to pay subscription fees.

Events 
Ask about this section
Copy for LLM

View as Markdown
Snapshot events allow you to track and react to activity in your Stripe integration. When the state of another API resource changes, Stripe creates an Event object that contains all the relevant information associated with that action, including the affected API resource. For example, a successful payment triggers a charge.succeeded event, which contains the Charge in the event’s data property. Some actions trigger multiple events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, it triggers both a customer.subscription.created event and a charge.succeeded event.
Configure an event destination in your account to listen for events that represent actions your integration needs to respond to. Additionally, you can retrieve an individual event or a list of events from the API.
Connect platforms can also receive event notifications that occur in their connected accounts. These events include an account attribute that identifies the relevant connected account.
You can access events through the Retrieve Event API for 30 days.

Setup Intents 
Ask about this section
Copy for LLM

View as Markdown
A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer’s payment credentials for future payments. For example, you can use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer’s card without immediately collecting a payment. Later, you can use PaymentIntents to drive the payment flow.
Create a SetupIntent when you’re ready to collect your customer’s payment credentials. Don’t maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents because they might not be valid. The SetupIntent transitions through multiple statuses as it guides you through the setup process.
Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments. For example, cardholders in certain regions might need to be run through Strong Customer Authentication during payment method collection to streamline later off-session payments. If you use the SetupIntent with a Customer, it automatically attaches the resulting payment method to that Customer after successful setup. We recommend using SetupIntents or setup_future_usage on PaymentIntents to save payment methods to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.
By using SetupIntents, you can reduce friction for your customers, even as regulations change over time.

Tokens 
Ask about this section
Copy for LLM

View as Markdown
Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our recommended payments integrations to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.
If you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.
You can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create Customer objects or External accounts. Radar, our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.

Payment Method Configurations

View as Markdown
PaymentMethodConfigurations control which payment methods are displayed to your customers when you don’t explicitly specify payment method types. You can have multiple configurations with different sets of payment methods for different scenarios.
There are two types of PaymentMethodConfigurations. Which is used depends on the charge type:
Direct configurations apply to payments created on your account, including Connect destination charges, Connect separate charges and transfers, and payments not involving Connect.
Child configurations apply to payments created on your connected accounts using direct charges, and charges with the on_behalf_of parameter.
Child configurations have a parent that sets default values and controls which settings connected accounts may override. You can specify a parent ID at payment time, and Stripe will automatically resolve the connected account’s associated child configuration. Parent configurations are managed in the dashboard and are not available in this API.

Ask about this section
Copy for LLM

View as Markdown
Prices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for both recurring and one-time purchases of products. Products help you track inventory or provisioning, and prices help you track payment terms. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by prices. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.
For example, you might have a single “gold” product that has prices for $10/month, $100/year, and €9 once.

Invoices 
Ask about this section
Copy for LLM

View as Markdown
Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.
They contain invoice items, and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).
If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, when automatic, does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.
If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your email settings, Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.
Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s minimum allowed charge per currency, the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.
More details on the customer’s credit balance are here.

Invoice Items

Invoice Items represent the component lines of an invoice. When you create an invoice item with an invoice field, it is attached to the specified invoice and included as an invoice line item within invoice.lines.
Invoice Items can be created before you are ready to actually send the invoice. This can be particularly useful when combined with a subscription. Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually charge or credit the customer’s card only at the end of a regular billing cycle. This is useful for combining several charges (to minimize per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your usage-based billing totals.

Secrets 
Ask about this section
Copy for LLM

View as Markdown
Secret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.
The primary resource in Secret Store is a secret. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.
All Dashboard users and the app backend share account scoped secrets. Use the account scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.
A user scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the user scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.

Instructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment_method into the request.
Stripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.
You can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.
Forwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.
