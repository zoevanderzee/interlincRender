Understood. Here is the precise, minimal list of what is missing — nothing else.
Your current form collects:
First Name
Last Name
DOB
Email
Phone
Address Line 1
City
Postal Code
Website URL
MCC
Bank Account Number
Sort Code
What is missing (required for Custom accounts):
Missing Field	Why It’s Required	Where It Maps in Stripe	What to Add in UI
Country (for the individual’s address)	Stripe cannot validate address without country → currently blocking verification	individual.address.country	Add a simple Country dropdown (GB default is fine)
Country + Currency for bank account	External account is incomplete → currently blocking payouts	external_account.country, external_account.currency	Add Bank Country (default GB) & Currency (default GBP) or infer from user location
Account Holder Name	Stripe requires this for bank verification	external_account.account_holder_name	Add a field pre-filled with FirstName LastName (or auto-set it silently)
Account Holder Type	Required by Stripe for bank accounts	external_account.account_holder_type: 'individual'	Do not show in UI — just set it in code
Product Description (fallback)	Stripe requires either Website or Product Description — if website isn't valid, this becomes required	business_profile.product_description	Add a 1-line field: “What service do you provide?”
**THAT'S IT.
No ID upload is missing.**
ID upload only appears later if Stripe flags the account → and at that moment requirements.currently_due will include individual.verification.document.front.
Right now, it does not, so no ID upload field is supposed to appear yet.
Your form should become this (added items marked with ⭐):
First Name
Last Name
Date of Birth

Email
Phone

Address Line 1
City
Postal Code
⭐ Country (dropdown, prefill "GB")

Website URL
⭐ Business Product Description (only show if Website is empty)
Business Category (MCC dropdown)

Bank Account Number
Sort Code / Routing Number
⭐ Bank Country (prefill GB)
⭐ Bank Currency (prefill GBP)
⭐ (Hidden in backend) account_holder_name = `${firstName} ${lastName}`
⭐ (Hidden in backend) account_holder_type = 'individual'
Backend Submission Should Look Like:
await stripe.accounts.update(acctId, {
  business_profile: {
    url: websiteUrl,
    mcc: mcc,
    product_description: productDescription || undefined,
  },
  individual: {
    first_name,
    last_name,
    dob: { day, month, year },
    email,
    phone,
    address: {
      line1,
      city,
      postal_code,
      country, // ⭐ NEW
    },
  },
  external_account: {
    object: 'bank_account',
    country, // ⭐ NEW
    currency, // ⭐ NEW
    account_number,
    routing_number,
    account_holder_name: `${firstName} ${lastName}`, // ⭐ NEW
    account_holder_type: 'individual', // ⭐ NEW
  },
});
Then call tos_acceptance.
If you add ONLY these 4 things, the verification list will clear.
So your answer is:
✅ Add Country
✅ Add Product Description fallback
✅ Add Bank Country & Currency
✅ Set Account Holder Name + Account Holder Type in backend
Nothing else.
