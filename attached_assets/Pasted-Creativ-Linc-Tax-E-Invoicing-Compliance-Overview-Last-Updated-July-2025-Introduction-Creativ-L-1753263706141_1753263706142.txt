Interlinc Tax & E-Invoicing Compliance Overview

Last Updated: July 2025

Introduction

Interlinc enables frictionless collaboration and payment across creative and project-based work without requiring manual invoicing. Despite eliminating traditional invoices, the platform remains fully compliant with relevant tax laws and e-invoicing standards through automation, digital audit trails, and partnerships with regulated financial providers.

1. Payment Compliance via Trolley Partnership

All payments on Interlinc are processed via Trolley, a PCI-compliant and globally trusted payment platform. Trolley ensures that:

Contractor tax forms (e.g. 1099, T4A, W-8BEN) are collected and filed.

Regulatory reporting obligations in multiple jurisdictions are fulfilled.

Know Your Customer (KYC) checks are conducted for all payees.

Trolley’s infrastructure classifies each user as a submerchant under a master account, keeping payment records distinct and auditable.

2. Invoice-Free Workflow That Meets Compliance Standards

Rather than requiring manual invoices, Interlinc uses milestone- and delivery-based triggers to generate payable events. These include:

Milestone completions

Task approvals

Deliverable sign-offs

Each payable event includes:

Time-stamped approval

Description of service or deliverable

Payment amount and currency

Payer and payee details

This data is logged and can be exported, meeting the requirements of invoice-equivalent documentation under most digital tax codes (e.g. OECD, HMRC MTD, EU VAT rules).

3. e-Invoicing Compatibility

While Interlinc does not generate traditional PDF invoices, our digital workflows are compatible with e-invoicing frameworks such as:

Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 (EU/eIDAS)

MTD (Making Tax Digital) in the UK

IRS electronic records requirements (US)

Users can export:

Transaction summaries

Digital receipts

CSV payment logs with payer/payee/project info

These exports satisfy recordkeeping and audit standards for both internal accounting and tax authorities.

4. Recordkeeping and Audit Trail

All financial activity on the platform is:

Logged securely

Exportable at any time

Associated with a project and user ID

This creates a clear, consistent audit trail. Businesses can share these logs with bookkeepers, auditors, or tax authorities to demonstrate compliance.

5. Custom Invoicing or Tax Documentation Needs

If a business or contractor requires:

Traditional invoices (PDF format)

VAT-inclusive line items

PO-matching

These can be enabled through workflow customization or third-party integrations. Please contact our support team to activate this feature.

Conclusion

Interlinc is fully tax-compliant and aligned with modern e-invoicing requirements, despite removing the friction of manual invoice generation. Through automated documentation, real-time audit trails, and integration with Trolley’s regulatory infrastructure, the platform ensures every transaction is legally and financially sound.
