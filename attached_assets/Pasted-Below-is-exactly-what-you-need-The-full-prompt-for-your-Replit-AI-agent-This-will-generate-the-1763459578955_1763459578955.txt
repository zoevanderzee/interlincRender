Below is exactly what you need:
The full prompt for your Replit AI agent
– This will generate:
• the modal
• the checkbox
• the UI blocking until accepted
• the code to store “acceptedTerms: true”
• the backend validation
• and integrate it into your existing registration page.
A complete, legally-strong, Interlinc-specific Terms of Service
– written to remove your liability
– aligned with marketplace law
– aligned with Stripe Connect
– aligned with your “contractor = merchant of record” setup
– designed specifically for your platform.
Everything below is copy-paste ready.
1. PROMPT FOR REPLIT AGENT (COPY/PASTE EXACTLY)
I need you to implement a full Terms of Service acceptance flow into my Interlinc app's registration system. The requirements are:

1. On the registration page (client/src/pages/auth.tsx), before a user can press "Register", they must tick a checkbox that says:  
   “I agree to Interlinc’s Terms of Service”.

2. Next to the checkbox, include a small “View Terms” link.  
   When clicked, open a modal (Dialog / Sheet component) containing the entire Terms of Service text.  
   The modal should scroll and include a close button.

3. The “Register” button must remain DISABLED until the Terms checkbox is checked.

4. In registerForm, add a field:
   acceptedTerms: boolean

5. Send this field to the backend during registration.

6. In server/routes/sync-firebase-user.ts:
   - Extend the registrationData schema to include acceptedTerms (required)
   - Save it in the database as users.accepted_terms (create this column if it doesn't exist)
   - Reject registration with a 400 error if it is missing or false.

7. Styling should match the dark-mode auth page.

8. Create a new file:
   client/src/components/legal/TermsOfService.tsx
   – this should simply export the Terms of Service text inside a scrollable container.

9. Populate TermsOfService.tsx with the following Terms of Service text:

----- START OF TERMS OF SERVICE -----

[PASTE THE FULL TERMS OF SERVICE I PROVIDE BELOW]

----- END OF TERMS OF SERVICE -----

10. The modal must support:
   - scrolling
   - a “Close” button
   - title: “Interlinc Terms of Service”

11. Ensure this works cleanly on mobile.

12. Confirm that the backend stores acceptedTerms in the DB, and that user cannot bypass it.

Make all required frontend + backend changes.
2. INTERLINC TERMS OF SERVICE (COPY THIS INTO THE MODAL)
Interlinc Terms of Service
Last updated: [insert date]
These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Interlinc platform (“Interlinc”, “we”, “our”, “the Platform”). By creating an account, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
If you do not agree, you must not register or use Interlinc.
1. Nature of the Platform
Interlinc is an online marketplace that connects Businesses (“Clients”) with independent contractors (“Contractors”).
Interlinc:
does not provide services
does not employ Contractors
does not guarantee outcomes
is not a staffing agency or employment service
does not act as Merchant of Record for contractor services
does not hold Client or Contractor funds
does not provide escrow
All work is performed directly between Clients and Contractors.
2. Accounts & Eligibility
To use Interlinc you must:
be at least 18
have the legal capacity to enter contracts
provide accurate information
not use the Platform for illegal or prohibited purposes
Interlinc may suspend or terminate your account at any time for violations, risk, fraud, or abusive behaviour.
3. Independent Contractor Status
Contractors using Interlinc are not employees, agents, or representatives of Interlinc.
Contractors:
operate as independent businesses
set their own pricing
are responsible for their tax filings
are responsible for compliance with local laws
own and deliver their work independently
Clients acknowledge that Contractors — not Interlinc — are solely responsible for the performance and quality of services.
4. Payments (via Stripe Connect)
Payments on Interlinc are processed by Stripe, not by Interlinc.
By using the Platform, you agree to Stripe’s Terms of Service.
Key facts:
Contractors receive payments directly via Stripe Connect
Interlinc does not hold funds
Interlinc is not the Merchant of Record
Interlinc may charge platform fees where applicable
Refunds are handled directly between Client and Contractor
Stripe controls onboarding, payouts, verification, and compliance
Interlinc has no responsibility for Stripe actions, delays, rejections, onboarding decisions, or payout schedules.
5. Invoicing
Interlinc automatically generates invoices or receipts as records of transactions.
You acknowledge that:
Interlinc is not providing tax advice
Interlinc is not responsible for your tax compliance
Contractors are responsible for issuing legally required invoices if applicable
Clients are responsible for their own bookkeeping and reporting obligations
Interlinc’s invoices are informational and provided “as-is”
Interlinc does not guarantee country-specific tax compliance or jurisdictional e-invoicing regulations unless explicitly stated.
6. Disputes Between Clients and Contractors
Interlinc is not a party to the contract between Client and Contractor.
Therefore:
Interlinc is not responsible for disputes
Interlinc does not mediate disagreements
Interlinc does not guarantee results
Interlinc does not provide refunds
Clients and Contractors must resolve disputes independently.
7. Prohibited Use
You may not use Interlinc to:
violate any law
distribute harmful code
harass or abuse users
engage in fraud or misrepresentation
solicit illegal work
avoid payment outside the platform
misuse data
Interlinc may suspend or terminate accounts for violations.
8. Intellectual Property
Unless otherwise stated:
Contractors retain ownership of their work
Clients receive usage rights as agreed between them
Interlinc claims no ownership over user-generated content
Users are responsible for ensuring IP agreements between them.
9. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law:
Interlinc is not liable for:
contractor performance
client demands or misuse
loss of revenue
loss of data
inaccurate information
downtime
payment delays
tax or regulatory obligations
damages of any kind
disputes between users
You use Interlinc at your own risk.
Total liability of Interlinc cannot exceed the total fees paid to Interlinc in the last 12 months (and may be zero).
10. No Warranty
Interlinc is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.”
We make no warranties regarding reliability, uptime, quality, security, or accuracy.
11. Termination
Interlinc may terminate access:
for violations
if required by law
if Stripe or a regulator mandates it
for risk or fraud concerns
Users may delete their account at any time.
12. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of:
England & Wales (for UK/EU users)
Delaware, USA (for all other users)
13. Updates to Terms
We may update these Terms at any time.
Continued use of the Platform constitutes acceptance of updated Terms.
