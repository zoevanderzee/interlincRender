You’re close. What’s missing (or mismapped) for Custom (application-collected) to clear requirements:
Add these fields
Country
Individual address country → individual.address.country (dropdown).
Some countries also need state/province → individual.address.state (US/CA/AU/BR/IN).
Phone format
Collect with country code (E.164), e.g. +44… → individual.phone.
Business description fallback
If the user has no website, collect “What do you sell?” → business_profile.product_description.
Keep MCC (business_profile.mcc) and Website URL (business_profile.url). One of URL or product_description must be present.
Bank (external_account) details completeness
Include country and currency for the bank account object.
Include account_holder_name and account_holder_type: 'individual'` (many regions require these).
Prefer a tokenized bank input; if not, send raw fields directly to Stripe and do not store them.
Example payload the backend should build:
external_account: {
  object: 'bank_account',
  country,            // e.g., 'GB'
  currency,           // e.g., 'GBP'
  account_number,
  routing_number,     // GB: sort code; US: routing; EU: use IBAN instead of both
  account_holder_name,
  account_holder_type: 'individual'
}
Dynamic ID upload (only when asked)
Add a hidden “Upload ID” section that appears only if requirements.currently_due includes:
individual.verification.document.front (and possibly .back)
Upload via stripe.files.create({ purpose: 'identity_document', file }), then submit:
individual: { verification: { document: { front: fileIdFront, back: fileIdBack } } }
Keep doing (but ensure it’s wired)
ToS acceptance after submit (no extra form fields)
Backend must set:
tos_acceptance: {
  date: Math.floor(Date.now()/1000),
  ip: <real client IP>,            // respect x-forwarded-for
  user_agent: <request UA>
}
This clears Tos Acceptance.Date and Tos Acceptance.Ip.
Exact submit mapping (recap)
individual.first_name, individual.last_name
individual.dob.{day,month,year}
individual.email
individual.phone (E.164)
individual.address.{line1,city,postal_code,country[,state]}
business_profile.url
business_profile.mcc
(fallback) business_profile.product_description
external_account (complete as above)
Then call ToS update.
If you add Country (+ state where needed), complete the external_account, phone in E.164, and a product description fallback, your Verify screen should stop listing those overdue items. The ID upload appears only when Stripe requests it, which is why you didn’t see it yet.
