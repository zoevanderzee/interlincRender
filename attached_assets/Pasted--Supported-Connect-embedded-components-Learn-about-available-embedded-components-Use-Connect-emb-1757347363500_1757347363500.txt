## Preview components

When using preview components, use beta versions of the Stripe SDK and preview versions of the [@stripe/connect-js](https://github.com/stripe/connect-js) and [@stripe/react-connect-js](https://github.com/stripe/react-connect-js) SDKs.

To create an account session with private preview components, use the Stripe beta SDKs:

- [Ruby](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby/#public-preview-sdks) `>=15.5.0-beta.1`
- [Python](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-python/#public-preview-sdks) `>=12.5.0b1`
- [PHP](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-php/#public-preview-sdks) `>=17.6.0-beta.1`
- [Node](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/#public-preview-sdks) `>=18.5.0-beta.1`
- [.NET](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-dotnet#public-preview-sdks) `>=48.5.0-beta.1`
- [Java](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-java#public-preview-sdks) `>=29.5.0-beta.1`
- [Go](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-go#public-preview-sdks) `>=82.5.0-beta.1`

Use the client-side libraries for rendering the private preview components:

#### npm

Install the library:

```bash
npm install --save @stripe/connect-js@preview
```

If you’re using React in your application:

```bash
npm install --save @stripe/react-connect-js@preview
```

#### GitHub

Download the [@stripe/connect-js](https://github.com/stripe/connect-js) and [@stripe/react-connect-js](https://github.com/stripe/react-connect-js) libraries source code directly from GitHub.
