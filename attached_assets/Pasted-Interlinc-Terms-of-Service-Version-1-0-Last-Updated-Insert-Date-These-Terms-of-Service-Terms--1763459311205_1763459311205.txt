3. No Employment, No Agency
Nothing in these Terms creates:

staffing or recruitment relationship
Contractors use Interlinc as independent businesses.

Interlinc does not:
guarantee payments
refund payments
reverse payments

6. Automated Invoicing
Interlinc automatically generates:
Business Invoice – issued by the Contractor to the Client

These documents meet globally accepted minimum requirements for accounting records, but Interlinc does not:
verify accuracy of information provided by Users

Users are solely responsible for meeting their own tax obligations.
