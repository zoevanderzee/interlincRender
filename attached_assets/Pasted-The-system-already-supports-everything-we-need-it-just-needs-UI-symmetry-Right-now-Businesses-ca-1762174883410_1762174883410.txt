The system already supports everything we need — it just needs UI symmetry.
Right now:
Businesses can enter a contractor’s code → sends connection request → contractor accepts.
Contractors cannot enter a business’s code → because the UI only exposes “Connect by Code” on the business side.
So the fix is UI only, not backend.
No new tables.
No new endpoints.
No new join logic.
No onboarding link system.
Just expose the same connection request flow to contractors.
What needs to change (minimal, correct, safe)
1. Contractors must see:
Their own code (already exists in Profile page)
A “Connect by Code” input (same dialog businesses use: FindByProfileCodeDialog)
Clicking it creates the same connection request, but reversed:
Contractor enters business’s code
System resolves the business user
Sends connection request to the business
Business approves (exact same accept UI as currently exists)
Nothing else changes.
2. Businesses must see:
Their own profile code, right where the “Invite” button used to be
Clicking "Copy Code" just copies their code
Remove the “Invite link” UI entirely
Businesses can still enter contractor codes the same way as before.
Final Flow (both directions)
Who initiates	They enter	Result
Business → Contractor	Contractor’s profile code	Contractor receives request → accepts
Contractor → Business	Business’s profile code	Business receives request → accepts
That's it.
Same logic.
Same database.
Same connection approval.
No changes to work requests, assignments, chats, billing, anything.
UI Changes Only (summary for the agent)
Tell the agent this exactly:
Remove the “Invite” link for businesses.
Both Business and Contractor users must be able to:
View their own profile code (already implemented in ProfileCodeSection)
Open the existing FindByProfileCodeDialog (currently used only by businesses)
Enter the other user’s profile code and send a connection request.
If the code belongs to a business, create a contractor→business connection request.
If the code belongs to a contractor, create a business→contractor connection request.
Do not change how connection requests are stored, accepted, or linked — reuse the existing connection_requests table and accept/decline flow exactly as is.
Acceptance Criteria
Business Profile page shows their code (copyable)
Contractor Profile page shows their code (already done)
Both see a “Connect by Code” button
Entering a valid code:
Shows correct user preview
Sends a connection request
Request shows in /connections
Accept works the same as now (no new logic added)
No onboarding links anywhere in the UI anymore
