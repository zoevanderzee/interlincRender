You want one thing:
Auth page is always dark mode: navy background, white text.
No matter what theme / palette / plugin is doing.
So we hard-code it. That means:
Do not leave the auth page dependent on bg-background / text-foreground etc.
Give it its own wrapper class with explicit colours.
1. Make sure the bad global override is gone
In client/src/index.css, make sure this is deleted (not just commented somewhere):
/* Light mode specific overrides */
:root input,
:root textarea,
:root select {
  background: white !important;
  color: hsl(215, 60%, 20%) !important;
}
If that’s still there in any form, it will keep randomly fighting with your theme depending on load order.
2. Create a “locked” dark auth styling
In client/src/index.css (or whatever main CSS you import in your React entry), add a dedicated class for the auth page shell:
/* Hard-locked dark theme for auth shell */
.auth-page {
  min-height: 100vh;
  background-color: #020617;  /* navy / very dark blue */
  color: #f9fafb;             /* near white */
}

/* Optional: make all text inside default to white-ish */
.auth-page * {
  color: inherit;
}

/* If you want inputs to be consistent too: */
.auth-page input,
.auth-page textarea,
.auth-page select {
  background-color: #0b1220;  /* slightly lighter navy */
  color: #f9fafb;
}
You can tweak those hexes if you want a different navy / white, but the point is: they’re fixed, not coming from theme JSON or plugins.
3. Wrap the auth page with this class
In your React auth page component (whatever file renders the login/register view – e.g. AuthPage, LoginPage, etc.), make sure the outermost container uses .auth-page.
Example:
// client/src/whatever/AuthPage.tsx

export function AuthPage() {
  return (
    <div className="auth-page flex items-center justify-center">
      <div className="w-full max-w-md">
        {/* your existing card / form / etc */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
Key points:
.auth-page must be on the top-level wrapper for that page, not buried inside a card.
You can still use Tailwind inside (flex, items-center, max-w-md, etc.).
Because we set color: inherit on .auth-page *, your text will default to white unless you explicitly override it with a Tailwind text-* class.
If you currently have something like:
<div className="min-h-screen bg-background text-foreground ...">
Change that to:
<div className="auth-page flex items-center justify-center">
or:
<div className="auth-page">
  {/* rest */}
</div>
and remove bg-background text-foreground from the outer shell so they can’t fight with your hard-coded colours.
