An Account v2 object represents a company, individual, or other entity that interacts with a platform on Stripe. It contains both identifying information and properties that control its behavior and functionality. An Account can have one or more configurations that enable sets of related features, such as allowing it to act as a merchant or customer.
The Accounts v2 API supports both the Global Payouts preview feature and the Connect-Billing integration preview feature. However, a particular Account can only access one of them.
The Connect-Billing integration preview feature allows an Account v2 to pay subscription fees to a platform. An Account v1 required a separate Customer object to pay subscription fees.
