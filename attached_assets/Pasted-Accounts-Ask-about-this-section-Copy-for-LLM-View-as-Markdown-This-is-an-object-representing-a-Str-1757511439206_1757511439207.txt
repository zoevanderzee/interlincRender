For accounts where controller.requirement_collection is stripe, which includes Standard and Express accounts, some properties are only returned until you create an Account Link or Account Session to start Connect Onboarding. Learn about the differences between accounts.

With Connect, you can create Stripe accounts for your users. To do this, you’ll first need to register your platform.
If you’ve already collected information for your connected accounts, you can prefill that information when creating the account. Connect Onboarding won’t ask for the prefilled information during account onboarding. You can prefill any information on the account.
Parameters


business_type
enum
The business type. Once you create an Account Link or Account Session, this property can only be updated for accounts where controller.requirement_collection is application, which includes Custom accounts.
Possible enum values
company
government_entity
US only
individual
non_profit

capabilities
object
Required conditionally
Each key of the dictionary represents a capability, and each capability maps to its settings (for example, whether it has been requested or not). Each capability is inactive until you have provided its specific requirements and Stripe has verified them. An account might have some of its requested capabilities be active and some be inactive.
Required when account.controller.stripe_dashboard.type is none, which includes Custom accounts.

Available countries include Stripe’s global markets as well as countries where cross-border payouts are supported.

Once you create an Account Link or Account Session, this property can only be updated for accounts where controller.requirement_collection is application, which includes Custom accounts.

tos_acceptance
