The only reason it’s not working is because the form data is never actually reaching Stripe — not because of Stripe, not because of account type — but because:
The backend is getting an empty request body, so it has nothing to send.
Once the body arrives correctly, everything else just works.
So we are going to fix one thing only and the entire onboarding flow will work:
✅ Fix: Frontend must send JSON instead of FormData
Right now your submit handler is likely doing something like:
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> … </form>
And because you haven’t called e.preventDefault(), the browser is doing a native form POST with application/x-www-form-urlencoded, which Express ignores in your current setup.
Replace your submit handler with:
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault(); // <-- THIS IS THE ENTIRE PROBLEM

  const payload = {
    accountId,
    firstName,
    lastName,
    dob: { day, month, year },
    email,
    phone,
    address: { line1, city, postcode, country },
    websiteUrl,
    productDescription,
    mcc,
    bank: {
      accountNumber,
      routingNumber,
      country,
      currency,
    },
  };

  await fetch('/api/payments/setup/submit', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  });
};
This one line:
e.preventDefault();
is the difference between:
Without it	With it
Browser posts empty form	We send full JSON payload
Backend receives {}	Backend receives real data
Stripe shows ALL fields missing	Stripe shows account verified
✅ You do not need to change:
The form fields
The Custom account type
The database
The Stripe update code
The ToS code
The payment logic
Only fix the form submit.
✅ After adding e.preventDefault():
Go into Network → Request Payload and confirm it now shows real JSON.
Then look at backend logs — they will go from:
ONBOARDING REQ BODY: {}
to:
ONBOARDING REQ BODY: {
  "accountId": "acct_XXXX",
  "firstName": "Ben",
  ...
}
and Stripe will immediately clear the “Provide X” requirements.
